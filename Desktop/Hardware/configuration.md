PC Part Decisions: https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/gdzT89

Cpu: Ryzen 9 7900X || Ryzen 9 7900X3D, I do not trust Intel CPU's based on *personal* recounts of a very trusted friend. 
GPU: RX 7800 XT, Only difference between Nvidia and AMD gpus is just raytracing and dlss, but I dont care for raytracing and theres alternatives already. Also alot of insanely good projects that have GPU acceleration just don't have nvidia becuase they're a pain so. 

CPU Cooler: Air Cooler, Thermalright Phantom Spirit, Air cooler > AIO because of reliability concerns, and PS isntead of PA becuase its just better. 

PSU: Corsair RM860x, I will not skimp out on what is the most important part of the build.
