# Considerations:

I do not trust Intel CPU's based on *multiple personal* recounts of a very trusted friend. Doing 'production' work as well, so while it's not a Threadriper like I would have preferred, it's still something I want to heavily invest a fairly large amount of my budget into becuase rendering, video editing, everything takes quite a while. 

Air cooler > AIO for of reliability + safety concerns, I very much do not want something that I need to open up every 6 months to replace the internal liquids of, as for why I chose the PS instead of PA: it's just the better and newer version. 

The motherboard is something I didn't want to risk as well, dictating power supply to the CPU + the usb slots and whatever other nifty requirements are on them. I wanted wifi on the motherboard, decent as well, I dont mind grabbing a wifi adapter but like, something directly integrated with the motherboard is just generally better, especially since there's no ethernet around me. I also wanted USB C & USB A ports. 

Only difference between Nvidia and AMD gpus is just access to raytracing and DLSS, but I dont care for raytracing and there's alternatives already. Also alot of insanely good projects that have GPU acceleration just don't have nvidia because they're a pain so. 

RAM unironically has no bearing, its DDR5, 6000Mhz CL30. Figured I might as well go with some RGB becuase I could, I did chose to go with a 2x32GB pack over a 4x16GB because I want to upgrade to even more RAM in the future when I have a bit more money to spend, I do know that 1x64GB exists but this motherboard does not support going up to 256GB, only 192GB.

Already have some storage, being the 1TB Samsung 970 Evo Plus, Got an additional 2TB HDD full of media as well, so I don't really need to get more, however I am agreeable to getting another m.2 SSD just for the sake of windows games, so I wager I can probably delete quite a fair few games off of my current external SSD once the PC gets set up. DRG, Warframe, Team Fortress 2, Dark Souls. 

NVIDIA versus AMD GPU's was honestly a tough decision at the start, becuase most media are arguing in favour of NVIDIA becuase of raytracing and DLSS and potential AI/ML applications, unfortunately that's all they really have. AMD GPU's have much better driver support, avaliable GPU acceleration on so many different applications and more VRAM. Had to figure out the different weightings, honestly performance wise, 4070 versus the 7800 XT are essentially the same, so I mgiht as well go with the one that has actual support and is cheaper.

The case is entirely a mixup, I just prefer to get something a *bit* smaller, so a Mid ATX case was something I was aiming for compared to a ATX case, it has more than enough clearance, with 302mm used out of the 400mm clearance, I was thinking of using an vertical gpu mount but then I realised the airflow completely suffers and either way I'm going to put a brace to help prevent GPU sag. 

I will not skimp out on what is the most important part of the build. The PSU is like, literally the most heat generative part of hte whole thing, and while the PC takes up to about 650W, if I had a 850W PSU that's still over 75% load, and that's alot more heat than I really want, so I figured I might as well spend a extra $40 AUD and get a 1000W PSU. As for why this specific one, well this is the nice and high quality one, even if the GPU nukes itself (again), the PSU will remain intact.
